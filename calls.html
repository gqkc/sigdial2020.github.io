      </ul>
      -->
      
	    <br>
            <p>
	      The Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL) organizers welcome 
              the submission of special session proposals. We welcome special session proposals 
              on any topic of interest to the discourse and dialogue communities. Topics of interest 
              include, but are not limited to Role of Discourse in NLP Applications, Explainable AI, 
              Evaluation, Annotation, and End‐to‐end systems. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      A SIGDIAL special session is the length of a regular session at the conference, and 
              may be organized as a poster session, a panel session, a poster session with panel 
              discussion, or an oral presentation session. Special sessions may, at the discretion of 
              the SIGDIAL organizers, be held as parallel sessions. The papers submitted to special 
              sessions are handled by the special session organizers, but for the submitted papers to 
              be in the SIGDIAL proceedings, they have to undergo the same review process as regular 
              papers. The reviewers for the special session papers will be taken from the SIGDIAL program 
              committee itself, taking into account the suggestions of the session organizers, and the 
              program chairs will make acceptance decisions. In other words, special session organizers 
              decide what appears in the session, while the program chairs decide what appears in the 
              proceedings and the rest of the conference program.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Submissions: </h3>
	    <p>
              Those wishing to organize a special session should prepare a two-page proposal containing: a summary of the topic of the special session; a list of organizers and sponsors; a list of people who may submit and participate in the session; and a requested format (poster/panel/oral session).	    </p>
	    </p>
	    <p>
              These proposals should be sent to conference@sigdial.org <mailto:conference@sigdial.org> by the special session proposal deadline. Special session proposals will be reviewed jointly by the general chair and program co‐chairs.

<h3>SUBMISSIONS</h3>
            <p>
              The program committee welcomes the submission of long papers, short papers and demo
              descriptions. Papers submitted as long papers may be accepted as long papers for oral presentation
              or long papers for poster presentation. Accepted short papers will be presented as posters.
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left:40px">
              <li><b>Long paper submissions</b> must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers must be no longer than 8 pages, including title, text,  figures and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. Two additional pages are allowed for appendices containing sample discourses/dialogues and algorithms, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments.
              <li><b>Short paper submissions</b> must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made  in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution; a negative results; or an interesting application nugget. Short papers should be no longer than 4 pages including title, text, figures and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. One additional page is allowed for sample discourses/dialogues and algorithms, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments.
              <li><b>Demo descriptions</b> should be no longer than four pages including title,  text, examples, figures, tables and references. A separate one-page  document should be provided to the program co-chairs for demo  descriptions, specifying furniture and equipment needed for the demo.
            </ul>
            <p>
              Authors are encouraged to also submit additional accompanying materials, such as corpora (or corpus examples), demo code, videos and sound files.
            </p>

            <h4>Multiple Submissions</h4>
            <p>
              SIGDIAL 2020 cannot accept work for publication or presentation that
              will be (or has been) published elsewhere and that have been or will be
              submitted to other meetings or publications whose review periods overlap
              with that of SIGDIAL. Any questions regarding submissions can be sent to
              program-chairs[at]sigdial.org. These restrictions apply only to refereed
              journals and meetings, not to unrefereed forums or workshops with a
              limited audience and without archival proceedings.
            </p>

            <h4>Blind Review</h4>
            <p>
              Building on previous year's move to anonymous long and short paper submissions, SIGDIAL 2020 will follow the ACL policies for preserving the integrity of double blind review (see author guidelines). Unlike long and short papers, demo descriptions will not be anonymous. Demo descriptions should include the authors' names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.
            </p>

            <h4>Submission Format</h4>
            <p>
              All long, short, and demonstration submissions must follow the  two-column ACL format. Authors are expected to use the LaTeX or  Microsoft Word style template from the ACL conference
	      <a href="[ acl2020. org/downloads/acl2020-templates. zip ]">http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip</a>. 
	      Submissions must  conform to the official ACL style guidelines, which are contained in  these templates. Submissions must be electronic, in PDF format. 
            </p>

	    <h4>Submission Link and Deadline</h4>
            <p> Authors have to fill in the submission form in the START system and upload an initial pdf of their papers before the March 6, 2020 deadline (23:59 GMT-11). However, you have until March 11, 2020 (23:59 GMT-11) to upload a final version of the papers. Note that title, authors and abstract cannot change after the initial deadline of March 6.
              </br>

      </p>
      <p>For special session long and short papers please select “Special Session Long (RoboDial 2.0)” or “Special Session Short (RoboDial 2.0)”.</p>

		  
<h3>ADOPTION OF ACL AUTHOR GUIDELINES</h3>
As noted above, SIGDIAL 2020 is adopting the ACL guidelines for  submission and citation for long and short papers. Long and short papers  that do not conform to the following guidelines will be rejected without  review. 
<h4>Preserving Double Blind Review</h4>
The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline up to the date when your paper is either accepted, rejected, or withdrawn.
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. By a version of a paper we understand another paper having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length (e.g., an abstract is a version of the paper that it summarizes).</li>
<li>If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the program chair(s) that a non-anonymized version exists. You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.</li>
<li>Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end of the anonymity period if possible.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Citation and Comparison</h4>
If you are aware of previous research that appears sound and is relevant to your work, you should cite it even if it has not been peer-reviewed, and certainly if it influenced your own work. However, refereed publications take priority over unpublished work reported in preprints. Specifically:
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).</li>
<li>In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited in addition to or instead of the preprint version.</li>
Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.
</ul>
<h3>MENTORING</h3>
Submissions with innovative core ideas that may be in need of language (English) or organizational assistance will be flagged for "mentoring" and accepted with recommendation to revise with a mentor. An experienced mentor who has previously published in the SIGDIAL venue will then help the authors of these flagged papers prepare their submissions for publication. 

<h3>BEST PAPER AWARDS</h3>
In order to recognize significant advancements in dialogue/discourse science and technology, SIGDIAL 2020 will include best paper awards. All papers at the conference are eligible for the best paper awards. A selection committee consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will select the recipients of the awards.
